# FlightRiskRadar - AI-Powered Flight Risk Analysis Platform

## Inspiration

FlightRiskRadar was born from a simple yet critical need: **making air travel safer and more predictable**. Every year, millions of travelers face flight delays, cancellations, and unexpected risks that could be mitigated with better information. Our inspiration came from:

- **Personal experiences** with flight disruptions and the lack of comprehensive risk assessment tools
- **Industry gaps** in real-time flight risk analysis that combines weather, airport complexity, and historical data
